<h2>Searching Techniques</h2>
<h4>Definations</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The process of finding the desired information from the set of items stored in the form of elements in the computer memory is referred to as ‘searching in data structure’.</li>
  <li>Searching is an operation or a technique that helps finds the place of a given element or value in the list</li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of Searching Techniques</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Linear Search</li>
  <li>Binary Search</li>
</ol>
<h3>Linear Search</h3>
<p>Linear search is a very basic and simple search algorithm. <br>
In Linear search, we search an element or value in a given array by traversing the array from the starting, till the desired element or value is found.</p>
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Take an array and the search key. Assume they are:- array and key</li>
  <li>Traverse through the array.</li>
  <li>Compare key with each element</li>
  <li>If the match is found then return the position</li>
  <li>Else repeat the process until the end of the array</li>
  <li>After traversing the array If the match is not found then return -1</li>
</ol>
